# 🧠 90 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **90-day DSA learning journey**!  
The goal of this repository is to **master core data structures and algorithms** for:
- Competitive programming
- Technical interviews (Big Tech level)
- Becoming a stronger Software Engineer

I will be studying **one DSA concept per day** (sometimes two days for harder topics).  
Each day includes:
1. **Concept explanation** (in English).
2. **Examples + TypeScript (Bun) implementation**.
3. **2 related LeetCode problems (free)**.
4. **Notes and reflections**.

## 📅 Study Plan Overview

The roadmap is divided into **13 thematic weeks (90 days total)**:

### Week 1 – Fundamentals
- Arrays (basics, two pointers, sliding window)
- Strings (palindrome, anagram, hashing)
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly, fast/slow pointer)

### Week 2 – Stacks, Queues, Hashing
- Stack, Queue
- Monotonic stack/queue
- Hash Table, Set, Map
- Recursion & Backtracking

### Week 3 – Sorting & Binary Search
- Sorting algorithms (merge, quick, heap, counting)
- Binary search (classic + on answer)

### Week 4 – Trees
- Binary Trees (traversals)
- BST (insert, delete, LCA)
- Heap / Priority Queue

### Week 5–6 – Graphs
- DFS, BFS, connected components, topological sort
- Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
- Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal, Prim)
- Union-Find (DSU)

### Week 7–9 – Dynamic Programming & Greedy
- 1D/2D DP (fibonacci, climbing stairs, knapsack, coin change)
- DP on strings (LCS, edit distance, palindrome problems)
- Greedy algorithms (interval scheduling, Huffman coding)

### Week 10 – Segment Trees & Fenwick Tree
- Segment tree (range queries, lazy propagation)
- Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)

### Week 11 – Tries & String Algorithms
- Trie (prefix tree, autocomplete)
- KMP, Rabin-Karp
- Z-function, prefix-function

### Week 12 – Advanced Graphs & Flow
- Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju, Tarjan)
- Bridges & articulation points
- Network Flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic)

### Week 13 – Math & Final Review
- GCD, LCM, extended Euclidean algorithm
- Modular arithmetic, modular inverse
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Combinatorics (nCr, Pascal’s triangle)
- Mixed problem review
