### What does **Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space** mean?

* **O(n) time** ‚Üí The algorithm‚Äôs running time grows linearly with the size of the input `n`.

  * Example: If you double the size of the list, the runtime roughly doubles.

* **O(1) space** ‚Üí The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra memory, regardless of input size.

  * Example: Even if the list has millions of elements, the algorithm only keeps a few variables in memory.

üìå Example: summing all elements in an array

```python
def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for x in arr:
        total += x
    return total
```

* Time: goes through all elements once ‚Üí **O(n)**.
* Space: only stores `total` ‚Üí **O(1)**.
